# CAN-NODE-AUTOMATIVE-PROJECT

ABSTRACT: 

The goal of microcontroller CAN bus project is to implement CAN protocol based data exchange between two PIC based boards, which are acting as “nodes”. In this implementation automotive use-case is assumed by exchanging data like engine temperature, speed etc. that are displayed using LCD panels. Along with this the CAN protocol has multiple other features like Bus Arbitration and Message Priority, Message Addressing and Identification and Error Handling.
